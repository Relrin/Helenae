Simplest analog of distributed file storages such as DropBox/SugarSync/etc.

Using
-------
- Python 2.7.5
- PostgreSQL
- Twisted
- Autobahn.ws
- OpenSSL
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Flask

Running
-------

For start working with distributed file storage you will need:  
1) Run the server.py by doing

    python server.py 9000

2) start few (minimum one) file servers from /fileserver/ folder

    # take example of fs.json
    python fileserver.py PATH_TO_config.json_FILE PORT

3) Open in your browser

    https://localhost:8080/
    
or run the Python console client

    python client_console.py 9000


Creating Server Keys and Certificates
-------------------------------------

TLS server keys and certificate can be generated by doing:

	openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
	openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
	openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
	openssl x509 -in server.crt -out server.pem

To run the server 2 files are required.

Private key (with *no* passphrase set!):

	server.key

Certificate:

	server.crt
