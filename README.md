=======

Simplest analog of distributed file storages such as DropBox/SugarSync/etc.

Using
-------
- Python 2.7.5
- PostgreSQL
- Twisted
- Autobahn.ws
- OpenSSL
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Flask
- pytest
- wxPython
- PyCrypto

Features
-------
- opening/writing/renaming/removing/transfering file or catalog
- synchronization files
- encryption by AES-256
- console/GUI clients
- supporting multiple file servers
- shared files between users (via creating links)

Running
-------

For start working with distributed file storage you will need:
1) Run the server.py by doing

    python server.py [port]

2) Start few (minimum one) file servers

    # take example of fs.json
    python fileserver.py [path_to_config.json] [port]
 
path_to_config.json its configuration file for fileserver.py, which contains:
- "path its" to place, where all files will be stored
- "base_dir" its just name for basic directory, which using for creating with "path" argument 
- "server_ip" means IP-address of this computer, which get access to connecting new users
- "server_port" means port, which listening server for connected users 
- "debug" means flag, which sending information about fileserver to server (by default its shall be false)

3) Open in your browser

    https://localhost:8080/

or run the Python console client

    python client_console.py [port]

or run the Python GUI client

    python client_gui.py [port]
    
NOTE: by default client applications using port=9000

Creating Server Keys and Certificates
-------------------------------------

TLS server keys and certificate can be generated by doing:

	openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
	openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
	openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
	openssl x509 -in server.crt -out server.pem

To run the server 2 files are required.

Private key (with *no* passphrase set!):

	server.key

Certificate:

	server.crt
